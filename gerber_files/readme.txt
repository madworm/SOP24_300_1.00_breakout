The front/back layers contain short and thin cutable/burnable traces linking
all pins to the VCC/GND planes. Due to their small size, it may be quite
tricky to actually cut these.

Therefore I added 2 new front/back layers that only contain the links for
the GND/VCC pins of the Macroblock MBI5030 chip.

If you should use this, please double check it nevertheless.
